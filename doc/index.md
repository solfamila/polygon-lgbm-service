# Tutorial: polygon-lgbm-service

This project is a system for **algorithmic trading experimentation** using stock market data.
It starts by *ingesting real-time* stock data from Polygon.io using a Java service and storing it in a **TimescaleDB database**.
Python scripts then use this historical data to *engineer features* (informative signals) and train **machine learning models** (like LightGBM) with walk-forward validation to predict future price movements.
Another Python service runs continuously, using the trained model to make *live predictions* based on the latest data, saving these predictions back to the database.
Finally, a separate Python script simulates **paper trading**, making hypothetical buy/sell decisions based on the model's predictions and tracking the simulated profit or loss.
The entire system (database, Java service, visualization) is managed using **Docker Compose**, and configuration (like API keys) is handled through `.env` and property files.
